A book about troubleshooting software

A software bug will keep on happening as long as its not fixed, as soon as its noticed it should be documented becouse it will happen again until its fixed. unlike other fields where the situation could change by itself or things just behave strange sometimes and dont happon again.

## finding a bug has a few steps.

### verifing that it is a bug
  sometimes the program is designed to do exacly what you think looks like a bug
### replicating it
  undersanding how its happoning by bracing down the program to steps and figuring out exactly when its happoning, and try to couse it to happen again to confirm.
  its hard to fix somthing if you dont know when or why it haponns
### undersanding what the code is supposed to do 
  what was it supossed to do and if you fix the bug will the program still do the business logic.
  
## Avoiding bugs

### after developing a new feature try using it
  after making a code change dont expect it to work just becouse it makes logical sence, run the new code at least one time to make sure there are no obvious issues, it could be syntex or system related.
